import from catia to abaqus | Step-by-Step Tutorial
In this video, I demonstrate how to import a model from CATIA to Abaqus, step by step. This process is essential for mechanical simulations and shows how CAD and CAE tools connect in real engineering workflows.

I'm sharing this as part of my portfolio to highlight my technical skills and English communication, supporting my goal of earning a fully funded PhD in mechanical engineering.
